# Newcastle City Council FOI Archive – The Recruitment Junction (TRJ)

This repository contains the **complete set of redacted documents** released by **Newcastle City Council (NCC)** in response to a Freedom of Information request relating to **The Recruitment Junction**, an ex-offender employment charity operating in the North East of England.

The archive is presented in its original structure and filenames to ensure **audit integrity**, **research reliability**, and **public accountability**.

This repo is maintained and mirrored by **The Reasonable Adjustment (TRA)** as part of its ongoing public-interest reporting on charity governance, safeguarding, equality compliance, and public funding transparency.

## 🔍 Background

In July 2025, The Recruitment Junction publicly claimed it received **“no public funding”**.

That statement does not match the evidence.

Newcastle City Council payment records alone show  
**£134,272.06** paid to the charity across several schemes.

The discrepancy, along with issues around safeguarding, abrupt withdrawal of support from a disabled service user, and inconsistent complaint handling, prompted a deeper investigation into TRJ’s public statements compared with official records.

The full write-up is available here:

📄 **“Caught in 4K: Recruitment Junction’s Public Funding”**  
https://thereasonableadjustment.co.uk/2025/08/19/caught-in-4k-recruitment-junction-public-funding/

This FOI archive forms part of that factual record.

## 🕊️ Why this matters

Public funding, safeguarding, equality compliance and transparency are not optional extras. They define whether organisations act with honesty and whether the people they support can trust them.

When real people's lives, health, or safety depend on truthful reporting, accuracy matters.

This archive is here to keep the record straight.
